*Ever wanted to use an instrument as your mouse and keyboard? Well now you can!*

## 🧠 What is Music-Keybinds?

**Music-Keybinds** is a magical little app that lets you use your **clarinet** (or potentially other instruments in the future!) to control your PC. That’s right — play a note, press a key. Blow a high C, click your mouse. It's like turning your instrument into a musical game controller. 🎮🎶

Perfect for:
- 💡 Accessibility solutions
- 🎮 Novel ways to play games
- 🎨 Creative control schemes for artists and streamers
- 🎼 Fun, goofy experiments because... why not?

## 🔧 Features

- 🎷 Real-time pitch detection from a **Bb Clarinet** (transposed 2 semitones up from concert pitch)
- 🎹 Map notes to **keyboard keys or mouse buttons**
- 🖱 Assign **clicks**, **presses**, and even **hold/release** actions
- 🧠 Note Stabilizer to reduce accidental inputs from shaky tones
- 🧑‍🎨 Custom profile system — save and load different control sets for different games or programs
- 🔍 Live visual feedback of pitch and input activity
- 🔁 “Learn Mode” for quick mapping while playing

---

## 🖥️ How Does It Work?

The app listens through your microphone, detects the pitch you're playing, and translates that into input actions (like pressing "W" or clicking the left mouse button). Everything runs locally on your machine with no latency-packed cloud nonsense.

> Currently optimized for **Bb clarinet** (E3 to C7 written range). Support for other instruments may come in the future!

## 🛠 Requirements
