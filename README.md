## 🧠 What is Musical-Keybinds?

**Musical-Keybinds** is an innovative application that allows you to use **Musical instruments** (like clarinet, trumpet, flute, and others) to control your PC. Whether you're using it to play games, create art, or enhance accessibility, **Musical-Keybinds** turns your instrument into a real-time input device for your computer.
